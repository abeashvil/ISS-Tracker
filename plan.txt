For now, lets start with image processing stuff. I have a flat map 
version of the earth which I can basically split down the middle for 
positive and negative points.

Then, I need to find a conversion rate for the single pixel size to 
distance in kilometers. Only then will I be able to map the points to 
the map. 

Basically, I'm going to draw the path which doesnt change for
15 days immediately. Then, based on a good time interval (minimum time
between updated points) I will update the image with the ISS's current
location. 

Some things to add:
    -Status of the ISS 
    -BIO on the current crew
    -Some statistics on the Solar activity
Later Features:
    -Tracking of ALL current space endeavors.
